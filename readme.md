# 🧠 Thesis ML Web App

A browser-based machine learning demo built for my Master's thesis:  
**"Exploring the Feasibility of Browser-Based Machine Learning: Challenges and Dataset Limitations"**

This project demonstrates training ML models like linear regression and neural networks **directly in the browser** using WebAssembly, TensorFlow.js, and Python APIs. It evaluates the feasibility of in-browser ML by testing dataset size limitations, model complexity, and performance.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Train models like Linear Regression and Neural Networks
- 🌐 WebAssembly + TensorFlow.js browser-based training
- 📊 Collect metrics: training time, inference time, MSE, R², accuracy, and loss
- 📈 Plot and visualize performance metrics
- ⚙️ Select dataset size and model complexity

## 🛠 Run the Web App

### 1. Extract Required Dataset

> 🔓 Make sure to extract `mnist_train_images.rar` at:
```
thesis-ml/neural_network/datasets/mnist_train_images.rar
```

---

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

> 💡 Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.  
> You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv                         # Create virtual environment

# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# For Ubuntu/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'          # For NVIDIA GPU support (slow to install)
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

To check if TensorFlow detects your GPU:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

---

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
cd thesis-ml
python server.py
```

## 🧪 Build & Debug WebAssembly (WASM)

> ⚠️ **Note:** You do **not** need to run this to use the app.  
> This step is only required **if you make code changes in the Rust modules**.

To compile WebAssembly modules from Rust:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

> 🛠 Make sure `wasm-pack` is installed:  
> Install via [Rust](https://rustup.rs):  
> `cargo install wasm-pack`
